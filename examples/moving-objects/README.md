# Moving Objects Map

This example combines a database-side state model of moving objects with a client-side map that displays the latest state of the system at all times.

We use the client-side map to add "motion" to the system by manipulating the location of the objects with simple up/down/left/right controls, but a "real" moving objects system would probably manipulate the object state by streaming in changes from GPS or other location aware devices.
